   Assignment 3: Number Guesser
   This program guesses numbers in a both psuedo random and
   standard binary fashion. The user thinks of a number
   between 1-100, and the program attempts to find out what
   it is. The extra credit part of this program was not
   implemented with the getRandomMidpoint function. A minimal
   binary search tree was implemented and nodes are traversed
   to the next numbers it uses to ask until it reaches a leaf node */
