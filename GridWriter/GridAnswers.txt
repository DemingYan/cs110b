1. this->x is necessary to refer to the member variable x, since the
constructor has a parameter x passed in, this is required to create a
distinction between the two x variables.

2. this->x and this->y in Circle are referring to x and y of it's base
class.

3. The keyword "virtual" adds that function to a run-time virtual table
(vtable) of function pointers, so that you may polymorphically call to a
function indirectly via a base type pointer. The purpose of "= 0" is to
create a pure virtual function, which must be implemented by derived
classes.

4. "Shape(x, y)" in this context is known as a delegating constructor.
This delegation will call the constructor of the base class for
initialization purposes. If you remove it, the base classes member
variables will not be initialized properly.

5. List polymorphic examples
