I've not taken any time to think about it at all, except that I would
print out a grid of the points and keep track of the ships that exist
inside of the grid.

I thought this assignment would be due at the regular time, sorry for
the lateness; personal issues have been destroying my life. Probs gonna
be homeless sometime soon.
